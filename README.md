Mile stone 1 project.

The brief was to create a website for a band but I have built one for a photography
website.

My wire frames are located in the "wire-frames" folder.

Including the home/index page, it's a 4 page website linked together via the 
navigation buttons on top of each page.

As you'll see when reviewing my wire frames, the nav lay out is different
on the home page than its is the other pages within the site, the home page doesn't
have a link to the home page either as you are on the home page.

The profile picture at the top of the page (in a circle) is linked to the 
home page.

I used external frame works quite exstensivly on the site, see below what was used;

-I used the the Bootstrap grid system quite heavily for the general layout of each
page and also to make the site responsive to device capabilities.
This you'll notice effects the layout of the navigations buttons on all the 
pages, the image gallery layout and the the footer sections.
This is so the nav links are easy to use even on small devices like mobile phones.

-Font awsome was used on the social media links at the bottom of the page and styled 
individually with CSS, same goes for the download icon for "dowload my buisness card"
Bootstrap glyphicons were also used for the navigation buttons.

-hover.css was used for the navigation buttons.

-Google fonts was used too, linked within the css pages. Font I chose was "Courgette"
with "Roboto" as a back up.

2xcss style sheets-I've used 2 css style sheets for this site, the reason being is 
due to the navigation layout being different on the home page to all the other pages.
I did this to avoid having to use a lot of duplicated coding and use of addtional wrappers
which would have made it harder for me to keep track of and debug if needed.
I know that scss and sass would be a way round this, but at the time I wasn't at on
that section of the course so wasn't comfortable using it. This I thought was a safe and
simple solution for me to use to get round this.

Images-lesson I've learned here is how image size can effect the dowload speed of your
page. First I loaded them up at 2mb each and the page took quite a bit time to load-longer
on mobiles! So images were resized down to approx 500kb, except for the image used on
the background on the home page "canal-dock-homepage", that was set to a slightly higher 
resolution as it takes up more screen space and thus pixelated.

Media Queries-Towards the end of building this page I used media queries to help aid
the responsive design aspect, I noticed when testing the site to try and brake it using 
chrome tools and even simply inspecting the site on my own phone. I noticed that even
though the navigation buttons and social media links laid out the way as I expected
but they were quite small and not so easy to use and often missed pressed the wrong link.
Media queriesto the rescue, these were used to make the buttons bigger on smaller devices.
Also it makes the site more aesthetically pleaseing when using on mobile devices.
Other small aspecs were changed too;
-Profile Picture increases in size slightly on mobile devices.
-Images within the gallery have a larger gap between them on smaller devices as they 
were too tightly packed on smaller screens.
-Increased space between social media links, again acompanied with the increased size
it helps make it more user freindly and helps avoid pressing the wrong link.
-Download icon was increased in size for smaller devices for the same reason as the 
social media links.
